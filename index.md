### 👋Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Mark
- 💼 Digital API Specialist @ FactSet Research Systems
- 🎓 BS Mathematics @ University of the Philippines - Diliman
- 🧑‍💻 Snowflake Snow Pro Core Certified
- 📍Dasmarinas City, Cavite, Philippines
- 📧 malabaclado@gmail.com


### 👨‍💼 What I do

I am a **Mathematics graduate** and **Data Professional** based in the Philippines, with a focus on bridging the gap between rigorous mathematical theory and scalable automated solutions.

Currently, I serve as a **Lead Specialist at FactSet**, where I act as a subject matter expert for Digital API products. During my first 18 months, I led an automation initiative using the **Power Platform** that revamped our internal queuing systems—slashing ticket acknowledgement times by **50%** and earning an early promotion.

**What I’m building now:** I am pivoting toward **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. From my undergraduate roots—using Support Vector Regression to predict Philippine stock prices—to my current focus on Snowflake and Google Advanced Analytics, I thrive at the intersection of finance and technology. I’m passionate about building impactful, automated systems that turn complex data into actionable insights.
