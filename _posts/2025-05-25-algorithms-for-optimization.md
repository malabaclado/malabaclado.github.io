# Algorithms for Optimization
## Population Methods 
Popultation methods for optimization involves using a collection of design points, called *individuals*, distributed throughout the search space. Information at different points in the search space can be shared between individuals to globally optimize the objective function. Having a large number of individuals distributed throughout the search space can help the algorithm avoid becoming stuck in a local minimum. Add
